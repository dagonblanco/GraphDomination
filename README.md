![Image](https://i.imgur.com/pCQxrT2.png)

This is an open-source project to develop an Eclipse-based (i.e. an Eclipse plugin suite) that will enable graph editing and domination study over the generated graphs.

It includes all the plugin projects required to use it as an Eclipse feature or to build an standalone application (Eclipse Product).

Main features:
- Model-based (EMF and Graphiti)
- Extensible

## Build

Maven/Tycho pom.xml files are provided so you only need to run

```
mvn install
```

On the parent project, and you will get all the plugin and executable files built for you.

Feel free to contribute via Issues or Pull requests.
